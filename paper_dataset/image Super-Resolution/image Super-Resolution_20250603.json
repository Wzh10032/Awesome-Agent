        "abstract": "Single-image super-resolution (SR) and multi-frame SR are two ways to super\nresolve low-resolution images. Single-Image SR generally handles each image\nindependently, but ignores the temporal information implied in continuing\nframes. Multi-frame SR is able to model the temporal dependency via capturing\nmotion information. However, it relies on neighbouring frames which are not\nalways available in the real world. Meanwhile, slight camera shake easily\ncauses heavy motion blur on long-distance-shot low-resolution images. To\naddress these problems, a Blind Motion Deblurring Super-Reslution Networks,\nBMDSRNet, is proposed to learn dynamic spatio-temporal information from single\nstatic motion-blurred images. Motion-blurred images are the accumulation over\ntime during the exposure of cameras, while the proposed BMDSRNet learns the\nreverse process and uses three-streams to learn Bidirectional spatio-temporal\ninformation based on well designed reconstruction loss functions to recover\nclean high-resolution images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed BMDSRNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, and has the\nability to simultaneously deal with image deblurring and SR.",

To address this challenge, we propose a\ndual-branch framework with an efficient self-texture enhancement mechanism for\narbitrary-scale super-resolution of pathology images.

Instead, lower resolution\nimages are upsampled to higher resolution using conventional interpolation\nmethods. Sophisticated learning-based super-resolution approaches are\nfrequently unavailable in clinical setting, because such methods require\ntraining with high-resolution isotropic examples. To address this issue, we\npropose a learning-based super-resolution approach that can be trained using\nsolely anisotropic images, i.e. without high-resolution ground truth data. The\nmethod exploits the latent space, generated by autoencoders trained on\nanisotropic images, to increase spatial resolution in low-resolution images.\nThe method was trained and evaluated using 100 publicly available cardiac cine\nMR scans from the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC). The\nquantitative results show that the proposed method performs better than\nconventional interpolation methods. Furthermore, the qualitative results\nindicate that especially finer cardiac structures are synthesized with high\nquality. The method has the potential to be applied to other anatomies and\nmodalities and can be easily applied to any 3D anisotropic medical image\ndataset.",

Recent unsupervised\napproaches search the latent space of a StyleGAN pre-trained on HR images, for\nthe image that best downscales to the input LR image. However, they tend to\nproduce out-of-domain images and fail to accurately reconstruct HR images that\nare far from the original domain. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we\nintroduce a new regularizer to constrain the search in the latent space,\nensuring that the inverted code lies in the original image manifold. Secondly,\nwe further enhanced the reconstruction through expanding the image prior around\nthe optimal latent code. Our results show that the proposed approach recovers\nrealistic high-quality images for large magnification factors. Furthermore, for\nlow magnification factors, it can still reconstruct details that the generator\ncould not have produced otherwise. Altogether, our approach achieves a good\ntrade-off between fidelity and realism for the super-resolution task.",
