### [Combination of Single and Multi-frame Image Super-resolution: An Analytical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03212v1)

**Authors**: Mohammad Mahdi Afrasiabi, Reshad Hosseini, Aliazam Abbasfar

**Published**: Mar 06, 2023 | **Updated**: Mar 06, 2023 | **Arxiv ID**: [2303.03212v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03212v1)

**Abstract**:
> Super-resolution is the process of obtaining a high-resolution image from one
> or more low-resolution images. Single image super-resolution (SISR) and
> multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) methods have been evolved almost
> independently for years. A neglected study in this field is the theoretical
> analysis of finding the optimum combination of SISR and MFSR. To fill this gap,
> we propose a novel theoretical analysis based on the iterative shrinkage and
> thresholding algorithm. We implement and compare several approaches for
> combining SISR and MFSR, and simulation results support the finding of our
> theoretical analysis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [Multi-Reference Image Super-Resolution: A Posterior Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09988v1)

**Authors**: Ke Zhao, Haining Tan, Tsz Fung Yau

**Published**: Dec 20, 2022 | **Updated**: Dec 20, 2022 | **Arxiv ID**: [2212.09988v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09988v1)

**Abstract**:
> Reference-based Super-resolution (RefSR) approaches have recently been
> proposed to overcome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by
> providing additional information from a high-resolution image. Multi-reference
> super-resolution extends this approach by allowing more information to be
> incorporated. This paper proposes a 2-step-weighting posterior fusion approach
> to combine the outputs of RefSR models with multiple references. Extensive
> experiments on the CUFED5 dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods can be
> applied to various state-of-the-art RefSR models to get a consistent
> improvement in image quality.

### [Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super-Resolution: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13620v4)

**Authors**: Chunwei Tian, Xuanyu Zhang, Qi Zhu, Bob Zhang, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin

**Published**: Apr 28, 2022 | **Updated**: Dec 23, 2024 | **Arxiv ID**: [2204.13620v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13620v4)

**Abstract**:
> Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the
> field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can
> achieve excellent results on low-resolution images with small samples. However,
> there are little literatures summarizing different GANs in SISR. In this paper,
> we conduct a comparative study of GANs from different perspectives. We first
> take a look at developments of GANs. Second, we present popular architectures
> for GANs in big and small samples for image applications. Then, we analyze
> motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization methods
> and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised,
> semi-supervised and unsupervised manners, where these GANs are analyzed via
> integrating different network architectures, prior knowledge, loss functions
> and multiple tasks. Next, we compare performance of these popular GANs on
> public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we
> highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points for SISR.

> stereo images) with a focus on new solutions and results. This challenge has 1
> track aiming at the stereo image super-resolution problem under a standard
> bicubic degradation. In total, 238 participants were successfully registered,
> and 21 teams competed in the final testing phase. Among those participants, 20
> teams successfully submitted results with PSNR (RGB) scores better than the
> baseline. This challenge establishes a new benchmark for stereo image SR.

### [Blind Image Super-Resolution: A Survey and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03055v1)

**Authors**: Anran Liu, Yihao Liu, Jinjin Gu, Yu Qiao, Chao Dong

**Published**: Jul 07, 2021 | **Updated**: Jul 07, 2021 | **Arxiv ID**: [2107.03055v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03055v1)

**Abstract**:
> Blind image super-resolution (SR), aiming to super-resolve low-resolution
> images with unknown degradation, has attracted increasing attention due to its
> significance in promoting real-world applications. Many novel and effective
> solutions have been proposed recently, especially with the powerful deep
> learning techniques. Despite years of efforts, it still remains as a
> challenging research problem. This paper serves as a systematic review on
> recent progress in blind image SR, and proposes a taxonomy to categorize
> existing methods into three different classes according to their ways of
> degradation modelling and the data used for solving the SR model. This taxonomy
> helps summarize and distinguish among existing methods. We hope to provide
> insights into current research states, as well as to reveal novel research
> directions worth exploring. In addition, we make a summary on commonly used
> datasets and previous competitions related to blind image SR. Last but not
> least, a comparison among different methods is provided with detailed analysis
> on their merits and demerits using both synthetic and real testing images.

### [Real-World Single Image Super-Resolution: A Brief Review](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02368v1)

**Authors**: Honggang Chen, Xiaohai He, Linbo Qing, Yuanyuan Wu, Chao Ren, Ce Zhu

**Published**: Mar 03, 2021 | **Updated**: Mar 03, 2021 | **Arxiv ID**: [2103.02368v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02368v1)

**Abstract**:
> Single image super-resolution (SISR), which aims to reconstruct a
> high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) observation, has been an
> active research topic in the area of image processing in recent decades.
> Particularly, deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) approaches have drawn
> much attention and have greatly improved the reconstruction performance on
> synthetic data. Recent studies show that simulation results on synthetic data
> usually overestimate the capacity to super-resolve real-world images. In this
> context, more and more researchers devote themselves to develop SR approaches
> for realistic images. This article aims to make a comprehensive review on
> real-world single image super-resolution (RSISR). More specifically, this
> review covers the critical publically available datasets and assessment metrics
> for RSISR, and four major categories of RSISR methods, namely the degradation
> modeling-based RSISR, image pairs-based RSISR, domain translation-based RSISR,
> and self-learning-based RSISR. Comparisons are also made among representative
> RSISR methods on benchmark datasets, in terms of both reconstruction quality
> and computational efficiency. Besides, we discuss challenges and promising
> research topics on RSISR.

### [PIRM2018 Challenge on Spectral Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00540v2)

**Authors**: Mehrdad Shoeiby, Antonio Robles-Kelly, Ran Wei, Radu Timofte

**Published**: Apr 01, 2019 | **Updated**: May 01, 2019 | **Arxiv ID**: [1904.00540v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00540v2)

**Abstract**:
> This paper introduces a newly collected and novel dataset (StereoMSI) for
> example-based single and colour-guided spectral image super-resolution. The
> dataset was first released and promoted during the PIRM2018 spectral image
> super-resolution challenge. To the best of our knowledge, the dataset is the
> first of its kind, comprising 350 registered colour-spectral image pairs. The
> dataset has been used for the two tracks of the challenge and, for each of
> these, we have provided a split into training, validation and testing. This
> arrangement is a result of the challenge structure and phases, with the first
> track focusing on example-based spectral image super-resolution and the second
> one aiming at exploiting the registered stereo colour imagery to improve the
> resolution of the spectral images. Each of the tracks and splits has been
> selected to be consistent across a number of image quality metrics. The dataset
> is quite general in nature and can be used for a wide variety of applications
> in addition to the development of spectral image super-resolution methods.

> major categories: supervised SR, unsupervised SR, and domain-specific SR. In
> addition, we also cover some other important issues, such as publicly available
> benchmark datasets and performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we conclude
> this survey by highlighting several future directions and open issues which
> should be further addressed by the community in the future.

### [Deep Learning for Single Image Super-Resolution: A Brief Review](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03344v3)

**Authors**: Wenming Yang, Xuechen Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Wei Wang, Jing-Hao Xue

**Published**: Aug 09, 2018 | **Updated**: Jul 12, 2019 | **Arxiv ID**: [1808.03344v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03344v3)

**Abstract**:
> Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a notoriously challenging ill-posed
> problem, which aims to obtain a high-resolution (HR) output from one of its
> low-resolution (LR) versions. To solve the SISR problem, recently powerful deep
> learning algorithms have been employed and achieved the state-of-the-art
> performance. In this survey, we review representative deep learning-based SISR
> methods, and group them into two categories according to their major
> contributions to two essential aspects of SISR: the exploration of efficient
> neural network architectures for SISR, and the development of effective
> optimization objectives for deep SISR learning. For each category, a baseline
> is firstly established and several critical limitations of the baseline are
> summarized. Then representative works on overcoming these limitations are
> presented based on their original contents as well as our critical
> understandings and analyses, and relevant comparisons are conducted from a
> variety of perspectives. Finally we conclude this review with some vital
> current challenges and future trends in SISR leveraging deep learning
> algorithms.

**Authors**: Yijie Bei, Alex Damian, Shijia Hu, Sachit Menon, Nikhil Ravi, Cynthia Rudin

**Published**: May 09, 2018 | **Updated**: Jun 16, 2018 | **Arxiv ID**: [1805.03383v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03383v2)

**Abstract**:
> This work identifies and addresses two important technical challenges in
> single-image super-resolution: (1) how to upsample an image without magnifying
> noise and (2) how to preserve large scale structure when upsampling. We
> summarize the techniques we developed for our second place entry in Track 1
> (Bicubic Downsampling), seventh place entry in Track 2 (Realistic Adverse
> Conditions), and seventh place entry in Track 3 (Realistic difficult) in the
> 2018 NTIRE Super-Resolution Challenge. Furthermore, we present new neural
> network architectures that specifically address the two challenges listed
> above: denoising and preservation of large-scale structure.
