We\nintroduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable\n3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key\ninnovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes\nconsistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D\nGaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A\ncompositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body\nparts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a\nnovel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These\ncomponents allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose\navatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any\ninput motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images\ndemonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin both avatar reconstruction and reposing.

To\naddress this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating\nvision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,\nmultimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual\ncontexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional\ntext. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual\nreasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,\nand math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with\nexplicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we\npropose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the\ncorrectness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness\nof tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the\nbest-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to\nsolve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.\nThese findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use\ncapabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic\nreasoning models.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in video diffusion models have driven rapid progress in video\nediting techniques. However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.
